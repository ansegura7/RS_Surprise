## Overview
Project of a recommender system created with the Surprise framework.

## Python Dependencies
- conda install -c conda-forge scikit-surprise 

## Examples

<summary>1. <a href="https://ansegura7.github.io/RS_Surprise/pages/RS_KNN.html" >RS with KNN</a></summary>
- Model built from a plain text file<br>
- The algorithm used is: KNNBasic<br>
- Model trained using the technique of cross validation (5 folds)<br>
- The RMSE and MAE metrics were used to estimate the model error<br>
- Type of filtering: collaborative<br>
