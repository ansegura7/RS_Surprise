# Recommender Systems with Surprise
Project of a recommender system created with the Surprise framework. With a collaborative filtering approach, different algorithms are explored, such as KNN or SVD.

## Python Dependencies
```
  conda install -c conda-forge scikit-surprise 
```

## Examples
<details>
<summary>1. <a href="https://ansegura7.github.io/RS_Surprise/pages/RS_KNN.html" >RS with KNN</a></summary>
- Model built from a plain text file<br>
- The algorithm used is: KNNBasic<br>
- Model trained using the technique of cross validation (5 folds)<br>
- The RMSE and MAE metrics were used to estimate the model error<br>
- Type of filtering: user-based collaborative<br>
</details>
<details>
<summary>2. <a href="https://ansegura7.github.io/RS_Surprise/pages/RS_SVD.html" >RS with SVD</a></summary>
- Model built from a Pandas dataframe<br>
- The algorithm used is: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)<br>
- Model trained using train and test datasets (80/20)<br>
- The error of the model was estimated using the RMSE metric<br>
- Type of filtering: collaborative<br>
